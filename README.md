a web automation project to collecting indeed jobposts.

1. using pyautogui to bypass cloudflare verification.

2. using selemiunbase to perform webpage interaction by searching, clicking and downloading jobposts.


TODO: 
after running for sometime (after collecting 300+ jobpost for around 30 minutes as my last try), program may be got detected 
(another cloudflare verification shown up) and will end with error. 
possible solution: detect error, bypass verification again, and resume with a new webdriver.
